# garrysmod_colorable_npcs
**WORK IN PROGRESS** This will make NPCs in Garry's Mod colorable.

This will override pre-existing models.



This code is practically an expansion to Hds46's NPC Color Randomizer addon: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2486931620
You will require it.

To use these, unzip the file and put everything in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons

This will make all of the NPCs in Garry's Mod 'colorable'. What I mean by that is this will make certain parts of the NPC's model colorable while leaving other parts of them the original color. Just like the player models.

If you want a specific color for the NPC, use the ragdoll colorizer tool: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267610127
